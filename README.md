# Transfer-Learning-and-Few-Shot-Learning-for-Deepfake-Detection-based-on-AST-and-ConvNeXt
Deepfake speech detection using ConvNeXt and AST on the ASVspoof2019 dataset. We explore full, partial, adapter-based, and few-shot fine-tuning to evaluate model efficiency and accuracy in low-resource settings. Achieved EER as low as 0.0543 with ensemble methods.
